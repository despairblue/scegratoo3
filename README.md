## Goal

### Building a web based 3D composition tool.

Build a web based 3D scene composition tool for the Project `Roundtrip3D` using current web technologies.
The Tool should provide following views and features
- A 3D View to visualize and edit 3D scenes in the X3DOM format
- A tree view to outline and edit 3D scenes in the X3DOM format
- A text view to edit JavaScript code
- A diagram view for SSIML (`Scene Structure and Integration Modelling Language`) models
- optional feature: launch transformation (transforming SSIML to X3DOM and JavaScript and the other way around) jobs on another machine running an eclipse instance

Requirements: model driven software engineering, web development, JavaScript programming, 3D modeling
